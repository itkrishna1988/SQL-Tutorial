Sure! Here's a user story for the **DOCd Home Page** in Confluence:

---

### **User Story 1: Create DOCd Application Home Page**

**Title**: Create a DOCd application homepage in Confluence for information dissemination and system overview.

---

#### **As a:**
Product Owner / Team Member / User of the DOCd system

#### **I want to:**
Access a centralized, informative homepage in Confluence that provides all essential information about the DOCd application.

#### **So that:**
- I can understand how DOCd works, its key features, system architecture, workflows, and compliance processes.
- I can easily find documentation, workflows, and diagrams relevant to DOCd.
- Team members, stakeholders, and other users can access a single source of truth regarding the DOCd system.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Overview Section**:
   - The DOCd home page should contain a high-level overview of the application, its purpose, and what problem it solves (event tracking, communication lifecycle management, and compliance).

2. **Key Features Section**:
   - List key features such as event tracking, multi-channel support, batch and stream processing, archiving, integration with vendors (USPS), bounce-back handling, etc.

3. **System Architecture Section**:
   - Provide a high-level system architecture overview in the form of a diagram (using Confluence’s built-in draw.io integration) showing how DOCd interacts with other systems (LOB, 1MCS, ComposeApps, USPS, etc.).

4. **Workflow Diagrams**:
   - Include at least two diagrams showcasing different workflows (e.g., digital email workflow and print communication workflow). The diagrams must be clear and explain how DOCd processes different communication channels.

5. **Event Status Definitions**:
   - Include a section that defines key event statuses such as Initiated, Composed, Emailed, Mailed, Archived, Failed, etc.

6. **Integration Points**:
   - Explain how DOCd integrates with internal systems (e.g., 1MCS, ICMP, ANG) and external vendors (e.g., USPS, IWCO) to facilitate communication.

7. **Failure Handling (Bounce-back)**:
   - Add a section that explains the bounce-back handling process and how DOCd transitions failed digital communications to the print channel.

8. **Compliance and Archiving**:
   - A section detailing how DOCd complies with regulatory requirements by archiving communication events, providing audit trails, and enforcing retention policies.

9. **FAQs Section**:
   - Provide a Frequently Asked Questions section to answer common user inquiries, such as how to initiate communication, track statuses, and handle bounce-back events.

10. **Contact Information**:
    - Provide up-to-date contact information for support, escalation, and other queries.

11. **Resources and Documentation Links**:
    - Ensure there are links to relevant resources, including user guides, technical documentation, API docs, and architecture diagrams.

---

### **Additional Notes:**

- The homepage should be visually structured for easy navigation, with each section clearly labeled.
- The page should be kept up to date with the latest system changes and workflow modifications.
- Diagrams should be easy to read, and interactive where possible (e.g., embedding Confluence diagrams).
- Provide quick access to resources such as documentation links and API references.
- Consider adding a version history to the homepage to track updates.

---

### **Story Points/Complexity:**
8 (Moderate complexity, requiring diagrams, collaboration across teams, and detailed documentation)

---

### **Priority:**
High
